### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I am a `Security Platform Engineer` at `Line-Yahoo Corp`, and my role involves ...
- Automating the generation of certificates for the massive number of instances that run `Line-Yahoo Corp`'s services.
- Developing security software that enables granular access control of the services above.

🔥 I resolve a minimum of one algorithmic challenge daily, as you can see on [my LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/mlajkim/)!

🏋️ I enjoy staying active with regular workouts, bike rides, and walks!
